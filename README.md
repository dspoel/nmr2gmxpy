nmr2gmxpy
=========

This program reads distance, dihedral and orientation restraint information
from Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) data files and converts it into GROMACS format.

## What is inside:
1. Library nmr2gmxpy_lib for nmr2gmx.py script;
2. The script nmr2gmx.py which does all the work;
3. Licence.

Before running the script you need to install the PyNMRSTAR package. You can find that here
https://github.com/uwbmrb/PyNMRSTAR. Download and run the setup script in that package.

Cheatsheet
----------
Here are the terms and abbreviations we will use:
* .pdb - conventional Protein Data Bank file with atoms names and their coordinats of a concrete protein.
* .str - file for NMR restraints V2 (STAR) data. There are other NMR formats with the same extension, but our program works only with this format, where the names of the atoms are the same as in coordinate file. Usually the name of the file is <protein>_mr.str.
* .top - file for GROMACS topology. This file can be generated by "gmx pdb2gmx" program from any pdb file. Don't forget that for different force fields topology files are different. Also always use flag "-ignh" to ask GROMACS put correct names for the hydrogens.

# nmr2gmx.py

## Run

There are two ways to run the program. 

1. The most convenient way is to just pass the pdb code of the protein of interest and let the program do the rest.
It will download all nessesary files (you need an internet connection for this). And then it will run GROMACS to create topology file (you need GROMACS installed in your path, at least version 2019.6). The command line is:
```
./nmr2gmx.py -n 1LVZ -v
```
2. Another option is to pass the .str and .pdb files (see Cheatsheet) directly like this:
```
./nmx2gmx.py -s 1LVZ/1LVZ.str -q 1LVZ/1LVZ.pdb -v
```
This can be convenient if you don't have GROMACS installation on the machine or/and no internet connection or if your structure is not (yet) in the protein databank.

In both cases you can skip the verbose flag -v to which allows you to see what is going on running the script. By default (no -v flag is passed) the program does not create any screen output (except errors).

For developers there is a debug flag -d which will provide errors traceback. Use it if you modify the library.

## Output

No matter how you run the program, it will do the following:
1. Create files with restraints. It can be distance/dihedral/orientational restraints, depending on what information is provided in the .str file. The names are "<protein>_<restraint>.itp
2. Include these files (or only one) in your .top file (this is done automatically by default unless something is wrong)
3. Create an addition to your GROMACS .mdp file (file with parameters for molecular dynamics). Copy what is written in this file and past in you .mdp file.
  
If you run the program using the first method (with name flag -n), then the program creates a new folder with the same name as you pass and all the files go there. This is convenient because you can use this folder to do you further GROMACS simulations. For example, it contains posre.itp (restraints for heavy ions) file which is produced by GROMACS not this program, but which you need to have more precise simulations. The folder structer also allows you to run nmr2gmx over a list of different proteins and don't mix the output.

## Class Atom_names

In a restraint .itp file, atoms are labeled not by their names but by their ordinal numbers with respect to the whole protein.
However, in a NMR .str file there is no such information. So one of the most important part of this program is to extract the correct ordinal numbers for atoms from their names and residue number. 

The default names of atoms used in protein_mr.str file and ones used in force fields (hence in gromacs files) can be different. So before we would try to find the atom number by its name and the residue number, we have to replace the "wrong" NMR-data names by the "right" force-field-names.

The current release solve this problem for AMBER force field, but allow easy implementation for any other force filed as follow. There is an abstract parent class Atom_names with 3 functions: 
1. read processed .pdb file and make a table of atom names, residues and chain labels
2. change the names of atoms if needed;
3. return the correct atom number for .itp file form the name of the atom and the residue ordinal number. 

Functions 1 and 3 are force field independent and are implemented in the parent class itself. Function 2 should be implemented for every force field in a child class, like is done in Atoms_names_amber for AMBER force field. Then in the "main function" the correct child class should be used. If in your force field all atom names are the same as in protein_mr.str files then you can use the parent class.
